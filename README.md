HW 2 VBA for Data Science Bootcamp

For this assignment, I developed a script that looped through the ticker, volume, opening and closing prices, as well as the highest and lowest prices for each business day. The script provided quarterly changes for each ticker, percentage changes, and total stock volume. I then determined which ticker had the largest percentage increase, which had the largest percentage decrease, and which had the highest volume.
